# ps-example Guide

This is a guide for adding examples that are available for all of PS. These examples are meant to illustrate use cases or show
samples of how Cloudbees products can either be setup, configured, or interacted with.

## Adding Examples

Examples should be inside of their own project folders, with all needed files contained within and the folder and is named in such a way
that a search can easily identify the example.

To contribute examples, place your example inside of the folder that corresponds with either the product or library that relates to
your example.  If a folder does not fit for your example, create your own.

Examples should have the minimum:

* Complete, functional code.
* A document file briefly explaining how to use the example and what dependancies are needed.

If you discover a bug, typo, or have an idea on how to improve and example, feel free to open of a pull request and submit the fix or
enhancement.  If you have a question or an idea that can't be submitted as code, open up an issue for discussion.

*Note:* All code stored in this repository should be considered public, do not submit any code with with secrets, proprietary IP,
or personal information.
