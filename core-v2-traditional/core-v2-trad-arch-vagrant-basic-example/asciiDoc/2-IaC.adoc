Now that we have picked an architecture for our Jenkins deployment, we need to define it as code and build it.  Since this is a tutorial, this has already been done for you.  Clone the the following repository to a workstation that have 1. https://github.com/[Github], https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox] and https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] already installed and configured and ready for use.

....
git clone https://github.com/lcorbo-cb/runbook-tp-vagrant.git
....


# The Vagrant File

Once you have the repo cloned you'll too a file called *Vagrantfile*, this contains our infrastructure described as code.  This will build:

1. 1x Operation Center
2. 2x Client Masters
3. 1x Shared Agent

## Run Vagrant

In the root directory of the repository, run:

....
vagrant up
....

This will build the environment, this might take a few minutes so while we wait lets review the code we just ran.

## Understanding the code:

This isn't a tutorial on vagrant, so we aren't going to cover everything.  However if you are new to this tool, first thing to point out is the syntax is actually just https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/[Ruby].  New to Ruby?  Well, it's really just repeated blocks of structured data.  You don't need to be able to code in Ruby to follow what it's describing here.

First thing to note on line 2

``  config.vm.box = "bento/centos-7.4"``

This is defining what "*box*" we are using.  A box in the context of vagrant is just a pre-made virtual machine image that can be used by vagrant to deploy a virtual machine for you to use in your environment.

In this example we are using a *centos-7.4*.

Then second this to note is that this file is basically a pattern, repeated four times each a variation of:


```
config.vm.define "oc" do |oc|
  oc.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.32.10"
  oc.vm.hostname = "oc"
  oc.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
    vb.cpus = 1
    vb.memory = 1024
  end
  oc.vm.provision "shell", path: "scripts/oc.sh"
end
```

Looks complicated, but all it's saying is that we:

* want a server called "*oc*"
* want it on our "private network" with an address of *192.168.32.10*
* want the hostname to be *oc*
* want it to have *1* cpu, and *1024* megabytes
* want it to run a bash script called *oc.sh* when the server starts up

For our purposes, we really only care about private network address, and the script runs on startup.  It's a private network, so it will appear on our workstation as an active IP address we can access, but it won't be available outside of our workstation.
