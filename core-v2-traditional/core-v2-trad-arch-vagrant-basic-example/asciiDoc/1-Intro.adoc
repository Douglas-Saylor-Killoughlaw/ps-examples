This tutorial is show our to create a localized test environment of Cloudbees CJE, consisting of:

1. 1x Operation Center
2. 2x Client Masters
3. 1x Shared Agent


== Prerequisites

In order to follow this guide you'll need to have some basic familiarity with the following tools.

1. https://github.com/[Github]
2. https://www.virtualbox.org/[VirtualBox]
3. https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]

You will also need to an open internet connection as many steps will require software to be downloaded from public sites.

The servers we will be building and installing will be *CentOS 7.4*, and commands ran on them will be covered in this guide.


== Basic Architectural Design

.Our Design

The design we are going to build and configure will be an Operations Center connected to two masters and a shared agent that can be used by either master. We will then create example jobs on both masters that explicitly.

This is a basic design, meant to be the a minimal viable configuration to illustrate functionality.  To be set up and demonstrated used the fewest number of steps possible.

It is not meant as an example of best practices, or optimal tuning.  It is also going to be deployed using https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant] which is not intended for maintaining production environments.
