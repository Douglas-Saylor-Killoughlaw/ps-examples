# Get_Jenkins_Token.sh

This is an example of using a bash script to obtain a Jenkins API token for a use with the Jenkins CLI, it obtains
a crumb from the CJOC, this allows us to call the rest API without having to disable CSRF.

## Dependancies

This bash script requires that following applications to be installed available in path.
* curl
* jq
* sed

Not having the above installed will prevent successful execution.

## Parameters

This script requires three parameters

* 1st is the URL of the Jenkins Modern Cluster.
* 2nd is the USERNAME of an existing user setup on the Jenkins OC.
* 3rd is the PASSWORD of the USERNAME.

## Recommended Usage

```
JENKINS_TOKEN=$(bash Get_Jenkins_Token.sh $JENKINS_DOMAIN_NAME $JENKINS_USERNAME $JENKINS_PASSWORD)
```

It is recommended that all parameters are stored in variables as this keeps secrets like passwords from being stored in your history. It is also
recommended that the output is also stored in a variable to make it easier use later within in the session.

IMPORTANT: Every time you run this script a NEW api token will be generated.  Previously generated tokens will still exist.  Tokens can be managed in Jenkins under the user configuration
page.
