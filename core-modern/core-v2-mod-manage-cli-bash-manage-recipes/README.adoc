# Manage_Team_Recipes.sh

This is an example of using a bash script that runs jenkins-cli.jar to backup the teams recipes in the recipes folder and if a recipe file is supplied as the forth parameter
it will upload the new recipe file overwriting the existing configuration.

## Dependancies

This bash script requires that following applications to be installed available in path.
* java
* jenkins-cli.jar
* jq

Not having the above installed will prevent successful execution.

## Parameters

This script requires three parameters

* 1st is the URL of the Jenkins Modern Cluster.
* 2nd is the USERNAME of an existing user setup on the Jenkins OC.
* 3rd is the PASSWORD of the USERNAME.
* 4th (optional) is the location to the JSON recipe file you want to upload.

## Recommended Usage

```
bash Manage_Team_Recipes.sh $DOMAIN_NAME $JENKINS_USERNAME $JENKINS_TOKEN
```

or

```
bash Manage_Team_Recipes.sh $DOMAIN_NAME $JENKINS_USERNAME $JENKINS_TOKEN recipes/recipes_smaller_disk.json
```

It is recommended that all parameters are stored in variables as this keeps secrets like passwords from being stored in your history. It is also
recommended that the output is also stored in a variable to make it easier use later within in the session.

IMPORTANT: Every time you run this script you will overwrite the file recipes/recipes_backup.json, and if you upload an new recipe file, it much contain the configuration of all
recipes in your deployment.
