# Create_Teams.sh

This is an example of using a bash script that runs jenkins-cli.jar to create teams as defined in the JSON files in the team folder.

## Dependancies

This bash script requires that the following applications to be installed available in path.
* java
* jenkins-cli.jar

Not having the above installed will prevent successful execution.

## Parameters

This script requires three parameters

* 1st is the URL of the Jenkins Modern Cluster.
* 2nd is the USERNAME of an existing user setup on the Jenkins OC.
* 3rd is the PASSWORD of the USERNAME.

## Recommended Usage

```
bash Create_Teams.sh $DOMAIN_NAME $JENKINS_USERNAME $JENKINS_TOKEN
```

It is recommended that all parameters are stored in variables as this keeps secrets like passwords from being stored in your history. It is also
recommended that the output is also stored in a variable to make it easier use later within in the session.

IMPORTANT: Make sure the name of the JSON file in the teams folder matches the "name" field in the JSON file itself.
